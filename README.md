# ML_Assignments
My own solutions for assignments of Greg Mori's Machine Learning class;

branch Master focus on linear basis function regression(sigmoid,polynomial),mainly for regression;

branch Master2 focus on logistic regrssion with (stochasitic) gradient descent,mainly for classification.

Can be run on python 2.7.x
